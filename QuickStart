-- Scope: The scope of this document is to go over the steps to quick start Firefox with human_app_label extension
-- Background: This extension runs with a lot of native support. Which means that a lot of things need to be configured
-- on the computer that is running it or else you won't get what you expect.

1) Run Install.sh to download all the needed stuff. Any issues on the install are bound to show up later. Be sure everything is
installed correctly.

2) Open /opt/firefox/human_app_label/NativeApp/Transport.conf to set the following options.
(The options will default if not specified)
-n /path/to/nfacctd.conf file.            Default /opt/firefox/human_app_label/pmacct/nfacctd.conf
-d /path/to/pmacctd.conf file.            Default /opt/firefox/human_app_label/pmacct/pmacctd.conf
-E Extended information -                 Default is to only get the minimum amount of data from the extension. If you want all the request headers and responses use -E 'All.
                                          Use a comma delimited list of the following details.
    'All' - As much information about request headers possible
    'BeforeRequest'       -- event details before request is made
    'BeforeSendHeaders'   -- event details before request headers are sent
    'SendHeaders'         -- event details when request headers are sent
    'HeadersReceived'     -- event details when response headers received
    'BeforeRedirect'      -- event details in case of redirection caused by response headers
    'ResponseStarted'     -- event details when response is received
    'Completed'           -- event details on request completion
-l /path/to/options/file                 Default /opt/firefox/human_app_label/NativeApp/options.txt
-j /path/to/output/JSONfile             Default /opt/firefox/human_app_label/NativeApp/output/connections.json
-c /path/to/output/CSVfile              Default /opt/firefox/human_app_label/NativeApp/output/connections.csv

3) Make sure the pmacctd and nfacctd are running.
4) Double click on the Blue Firefox icon on your favorites bar.
5) Browse the internet as usual.
6) After closing all browser windows you need to wait 5 minutes for pmacctd to finish writing.
7) Look in /opt/firefox/human_app_label/NativeApp/mergedOutput for the latest file. That should have your output.
