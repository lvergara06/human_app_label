-- on the computer that is running it or else you won't get what you expect.

1) Run Install.sh to download all the needed stuff. Any issues on the install are bound to show up later. Be sure everything is
installed correctly.

2) Open /opt/firefox/user_to_network/user_to_network_NativeApp/Transport.conf to set the following options.
(The options will default if not specified)
-d /path/to/pmacctd.conf file.            Default /opt/firefox/user_to_network/pmacct/pmacctd.conf

-E Extended information -                 Default is to only get the minimum amount of data from the extension. If you want all the request headers and responses use -E 'All.

    'BeforeRequest'       -- event details before request is made
